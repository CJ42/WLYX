# Wrapped LYX - WLYX

> ‚ö†Ô∏è üöß **Warning**: this is an experimental project to test the capabilities of LSP7. This contract has not been audited and thoroughly tested. **Do not use in production**.

Solidity codebase of [Wrapped LYX (WLYX)](https://github.com/CJ42/WLYX/blob/master/src/WLYX.sol), the equivalent of the [WETH token contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#code) from Ethereum on LUKSO.

This repository aims to test the LUKSO [LSP7](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-7-DigitalAsset.md) standard by re-creating a basic and popular token contract like WETH, but implementing the LSP7 token contract from the start.
